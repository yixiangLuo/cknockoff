    c(person("Yixiang", "Luo", role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email="yixiangluo@berkeley.edu"),
      person("William", "Fithian", role = c("ctb")),
      person("Lihua", "Lei", role = c("ctb")))
Description: The cKnockoff method is a multiple testing procedure applied to 
    the linear model for variable selection with FDR control. It almost surely
    dominates the fixed-X knockoff procedure.
